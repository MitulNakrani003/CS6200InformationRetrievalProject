Grade and Milestones

FOR B
1. Label a minimum of 25 queries with their corresponding relevant documents. 
2. Collect and preprocess data based on these queries by fetching data from APIs on the internet, setting up a robust data processing pipeline. 
3. Implement a transformer-based summarization model (BART) to generate document summaries. 
4. Apply BM25 as the retrieval model to retrieve documents based on the annotated queries. 
5. Evaluate retrieval performance using Mean Average Precision (MAP).

FOR B+	
1. Integrate an additional summarization model (Pegasus) to generate document summaries. 
2. Perform document retrieval using BM25 on the newly summarized dataset. 
3. Compare retrieval performance between the original system (full-text retrieval) and the summarization-enhanced system.
4. Track and compare retrieval performance using evaluation measures like F1-Score, Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR), Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG) and more.

FOR A-	
1. Introduce a third summarization model (LongFormer) to analyze different summarization techniques. 
2. Apply document retrieval using BM25 and compare its performance against retrieval using LongFormer-generated summaries. 
3. Evaluate retrieval effectiveness by comparing BM25 with different summarization-enhanced retrieval models. 
4. Fine-tune BM25 hyperparameters to optimize ranking accuracy.

FOR A	
1. Try retrival using QueryLikeliHood models to evaluate retrieval performance on summeries.
2. Incorporate an additional T5 summerization model for retrieval alongside BM25.
3. Optimize hyperparameters for summerizations models to improve retrieval performance.
4. Conduct a comprehensive evaluation comparing all retrieval models (BART, Pegasus, T5, and LongFormer) to assess their effectiveness.
5. Deliver an in-depth analysis discussing the strengths, limitations, and ideal use cases for each retrieval approach.
